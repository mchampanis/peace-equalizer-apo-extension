# AutoIt switches and dial knobs system

Copyright P.E. Verbeek, version 1.17

For this system to work all you need is to include Knobs.au3 and add (a folder with) images for the switches and rotary knobs.  
Example images are located in the Images folder.  
Note: All images are **90 dpi**. As gdi+ only rotates image of 90 dpi correctly so the following must be 90 dpi:

*knobdialback.png* and *knobdialbackdisabled.png*

*knobdialfront.png* and *knobdialfrontdisabled.png*

You can browse through *Peace.au3* to see how I use this system for the *Peace effects panel*.
